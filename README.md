https://forkify-final-javad.netlify.app

You can search for recipe by name and get the so many info about that food 

NOTE: I just use pure javascript 
thing that i use 

1) leaflet libray 
2) use Class base javascript
3) use promise to work with API 
4) using isNodeEqual to preventing re-render all the page (for better performance)
5) paginiation with js 
6) use Preprocessor (SASS)
