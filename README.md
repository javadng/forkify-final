You can search for recipe by name and get the so many info about that food 

NOTE: I just use pure javascript  

1) use Class base javascript
2) use promise to work with API 
3) using isNodeEqual to preventing re-render all the page (for better performance)
4) paginiation with js 
5) use Preprocessor (SASS)
